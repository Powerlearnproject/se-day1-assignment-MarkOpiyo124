#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software systems and its significance is that it's relaiable, scalable and it's cost and time efficient.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Nato 1968 conference- considered the "birthplace" of software engineering, this conference in Garmisch, Germany, addressed the "software crisis"—a term describing the frequent failures of large, complex software projects due to poor management, unreliable code, and cost overruns.
OOP's Adoption-OOP (pioneered by languages like Smalltalk, C++, and Java) introduced concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism, enabling modular, reusable, and maintainable code.
 The Agile Manifesto (2001) & DevOps Movement (2008–2010s)-Frustration with rigid, documentation-heavy processes led software developers to draft the Agile Manifesto, prioritizing:

Individuals and interactions over processes/tools.

Working software over comprehensive documentation.

Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.

Responding to change over following a plan.

Later, DevOps emerged, integrating development and operations for faster, automated deployments (CI/CD, Kubernetes, cloud infrastructure).



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirement Gathering & Analysis-This helps to understand what the software should do by collecting input from stakeholders like clients, users, ect
System Design-Planing of the software architecture and technical specifications before coding begins.
Implementation (Coding)- Writing the actual code based on the design documents.
Testing-Identifying and fixing defects to ensure software reliability
Deployment-Releaseing the software to users.
Maintenance & Support-Ensure the software remains functional, secure, and up-to-date.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
 Waterfall suits stable projects where requirements are clear and unlikely to change for example building a payroll system with strict legal requirements; Agile fits in fast-changing environments that needs rapid adjustments based on market demands for example Software with frequent updates like e-commerce platforms.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.Software Developer role is to builds and maintains software applications.

Responsibilities:

Writes clean, efficient code based on requirements.

Fixes bugs and improves existing features.

Collaborates with QA and designers to refine functionality.

Tests code before submitting for review.

2. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer role is to ensures software is reliable and bug-free.

Responsibilities:

Designs and executes test cases to identify defects.

Reports bugs to developers and verifies fixes.

Ensures software meets performance and security standards.

Automates tests to improve efficiency.

3. Project Manager (PM) role is to lead the team to deliver projects on time and within scope.

Responsibilities:

Plans timelines, budgets, and resources.

Coordinates between developers, QA, and stakeholders.

Tracks progress and removes roadblocks.

Ensures clear communication and alignment on goals.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) Streamlines coding by combining essential tools into a single platform makeing coding faster and less error-prone.Thus it is efficient, productive and reduces error example are visual studio,Intellij IDEA and PyCharm.
2. Version Control Systems (VCS) Tracks and manage code changes, enabling collaboration and history retention, it ensures safe, organized teamwork and code history through collaboration, Backup and recovery and branching and merging. Examples are Git (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) and Subversion (SVN): 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Changing Requirements
Challenge: Clients or stakeholders frequently update project needs, causing delays or rework.
Solution:Use Agile methodologies (e.g., Scrum) for iterative feedback and document requirements clearly and validate them early.

2. Tight Deadlines
Challenge: Unrealistic timelines lead to rushed, buggy code.
Solution:Break tasks into smaller milestones (sprints)

3. Debugging Complex Issues
Challenge: Hard-to-reproduce bugs waste time.
Solution:Write unit tests and use debugging tools (e.g. Chrome DevTools, GDB) and implement logging (e.g. ELK Stack) to trace errors.

4. Legacy Code Maintenance
Challenge: Outdated, poorly documented code is hard to modify.
Solution:Document dependencies and workflows before making changes.

5. Team Collaboration Issues
Challenge: Miscommunication or merge conflicts in shared codebases.
Solution:Use Git best practices (feature branches, pull requests) and hold daily stand-ups and code reviews.

6. Security Vulnerabilities
Challenge: Cyber threats (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
Solution:Regular penetration testing and dependency checks (Snyk).

7. Burnout
Challenge: Long hours and high stress reduce productivity.
Solution:Advocate for sustainable pacing (e.g., 40-hour workweeks) and automate repetitive tasks (CI/CD pipelines)

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing tests individual components like functions and classes in isolation by a developer writing small, automated tests (e.g., JUnit for Java, pytest for Python).
Importance:Catches bugs early in development and simplifies debugging by isolating failures.

2. Integration Testing checks interactions between combined modules/services with tools like Postman (APIs) or TestNG (Java).
Importance:Uncovers issues in data flow (e.g., API mismatches, database errors)and ensures modules work together as designed.

3. System Testing validates the entire system against requirements through end-to-end (E2E) tests using tools like Selenium (web) or Cypress.

Importance:Verifies compliance with specs (functional and non-functional) and tests performance, security, and usability under real-world conditions.

4. Acceptance Testing confirms the software meets business/user needs.
Importance:Ensures the software solves the intended problem and it's the final gate before deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining input instructions (prompts) to optimize the output of AI models, particularly large language models like ChatGP Tand it involves crafting clear, structured, and context-rich queries to guide the AI toward desired responses.

Why is Prompt Engineering Important?
Improves Accuracy & Relevance-well-designed prompts reduce vague or incorrect answers.

Enhances Control Over AI Outputs specifying format e.g tables, tone (professional/casual), or constraints (word count) ensures usable results.

Saves Time & Iterations, clear prompts minimize back-and-forth with the AI.

Enables Complex Task Automation - Multi-step prompts can automate workflows (e.g., data analysis, content generation).

Mitigates Bias/Errors - Carefully phrased prompts reduce harmful or biased outputs.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Example: Vague vs. Improved Prompt
❌ Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about dogs."

Problems:

Too broad (could cover breeds, behavior, history, etc.).

No context or goal (e.g., for research, a child’s homework, or a vet’s guide).

Unclear output format (paragraphs, bullets, length).

✅ Improved Prompt:
"Provide a concise, 3-bullet summary of the top 3 most popular dog breeds in the U.S. for a 10-year-old. Include their average size and temperament."

Why It’s Better:

Specific Scope: Focuses on popular breeds, not all dog-related info.

Clear Audience: Tailored for a 10-year-old (simple language).

Structured Output: Requests 3 bullets with size/temperament—easy to digest.

Purpose-Driven: Useful for a child’s school project (avoids irrelevant details).

Key Prompt Engineering Tips Applied:
Constraints: "3-bullet," "popular breeds in the U.S."

Context: "For a 10-year-old" (simplifies language).

Actionable Output: Size/temperament comparison.

Result: The AI generates focused, age-appropriate info quickly, avoiding a wall of text about canine evolution or medical details.
